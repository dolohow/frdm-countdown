# Countdown Timer
- - -
![kl46z]
## Requirements
* Freedom KL46Z board
* CMSIS libraries

## Prerequisites
Please use mbed OpenSDA from [here][1] to generate 32.768kHZ on `PTC1` (`RTC_CLKIN`).

## Compilation
You can use any compilator you want, but you need to obtain a copy of headers.
I also prepared so called import file `countdown.uvprojx` that you can use with *Keil ÂµVision*.

## Basic usage
By sliding through `TSI` you can change seconds, while the `SW1` can increase minutes.
To start countdown simply press `SW2` button.
You will be informed of an end counting when diodes start blinking. Then pushing `SW2` button will switch them off.
